## Project Description
We are data scientist at Cookie Flea and we want to have the best cookies in the world! For this reason we are implementing a model on ML to predict the recipe that will give us the best quality cookies! 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
At the very begninng we think that the best quality cookies will be those that contain chocolate, that are crunchy and the aesthetics of the cookie itself. 

Considering the Codebook, our first hypotheses to a best cookie are : 
* sugar to flour ratio 
* bake temp 
* mixings 
* butter type 
* crunch factor 

The main questions we want to answer are: 

* Which are the main ingredients that gives you the best quality cookie? 
* Are higher calories a synomym of a best quality cookie? 

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The data we are looking in order to win the cookie contest is a dataset with 16 columns that are our features or cookie elements/ingredients, and 5198 rows, that are different cookies  that have been studied. This dataset has been bought to a company that analyses several products. 


<a name="cleaning"></a>

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did, etc, as well as your thinking process.

<a name="analysis"></a>

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. 
* If you use ML in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

<a name="conclusion"></a>

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

<a name="future-work"></a>

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
1. Trello Organization 
2. Project initialization: .gitignore, database downloading, repository creation, collaborators added to the repo and README.md file.
3. Hypotheses writing. 
4. Data Cleaning
5. Basic Statistics 
6. Model and metric selection 
7. Model development and Model Evaluation
8. Project Review: Explanations and Conclusions 
9. Slides 
10. Presentation

<a name="organization"></a>

## Organization
We are working as team of data scientists at Cookie Flea. To achieve our goals we have structured the workflow as mentioned aboved. We are using Trello, Github, Jupyter Notebooks and Google Slides to achieve our objectives. The repo is structured as follows: 
- Data: Folder with the raw data csv and the cleaned dataset 
- Jupyter_Notebooks: Folder with two Jupyter Notebooks: one for data cleaning and the other one for the model development
